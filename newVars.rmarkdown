Speechiness_cat is created from speechiness, in which tracks with a value [\<]{.underline} 0.33 are likely non-speech tracks, tracks with a value \>0.33 or \<0.66 are likely music and speech, and [\>]{.underline}0.66 are likely spoken word tracks.                                   |

: New Spotify data variables {#tbl-newvars}

@tbl-newvars describes 8 new variables, classicalness, title.words, norm.loudness, norm.tempo, itensity, livetrack, duration_mins, speechiness_cat, created from the Spotify dataset. The table provides the class, range, and description of each new variable.
